# Micromouse

## Components
1. 4 IR sensors - for measuring whether or not walls are present when entering the maze
2. 4 12-V Gear Motors - for motion of the robot
3. Motor Driver - for driving the 4 motors
4. ESP8266 - microcontroller used for the robot
5. MPU6050 - gyroscop module to determine the position of the robot

## Todo
